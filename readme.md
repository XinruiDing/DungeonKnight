## ✨ Final Project for CS50 Game

## **DUNGEON KNIGHT**

### ✨ Introduction
Embark on an epic journey through the shadows in "Dungeon Knight," where classic roguelike mechanics meet the charming storytelling of Hollow Knight. Forge your path, upgrade your arsenal, and unravel the mysteries of the dungeon.

### ✨ Design
- The main map has three merchants — Charm Merchant, Mask Merchant (each mask represents an extra life), and a Weapons Upgrade Merchant (upgraded sword provides more damage) — alongside the dungeon entrance. 
- Each dungeon randomly generates three to four rooms. 
- In each dungeon journey, player will yield monster-dropped gold and occasionally uncovers hidden rooms that offer a random charm or an extra mask. 
- Each run culminates in a battle against an elite monster, after which the player will have an opportunity to converse with a sage to claim a gem. 
- If player fail in battle, spoils will not get lost but can be spent on the main map. 
- Each gem offers a choice called "a blessing and a curse," allowing player to smash a charm for a mask or a mask for gold. 
- After collecting three gems, player can forge the Void Heart, which allows player to confront the Hollow Knight directly in the next dungeon.
- Finally, player defeat the Hollow Knight to win the game, or face a reset and start a new adventure.
